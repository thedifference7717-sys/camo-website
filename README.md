# CAMO website

Static site built from the website design (https://claude.ai/artifact/QB6piNbZWjL9suC5Kvfirw).
Plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step, no third-party requests (fonts are self-hosted, strict CSP), so
visitors' IPs are not leaked to Google Fonts, analytics or CDNs.

## Hosting (free)
This repo is the public copy of `website/` from the CAMO code repo. Edit the site there and copy the
changes here (or edit here and copy back) so the two stay in sync. To serve it, either:
- **Cloudflare Pages**: connect the repo, framework "None", build command empty, output directory `/`.
- **GitHub Pages**: Settings → Pages → deploy from branch `main`, folder `/ (root)`.

## Before publishing
- Downloads (Dec 7), mining guide, block explorer and community links are shown as "soon"; replace them with
  real links when they exist.
- The GitHub link 404s until the repo is made public (planned Nov 10).
- Keep supply numbers, burn address and dates in sync with `CLAUDE.md`, `contrib/camo/ALLOCATION.md` and the
  white paper.
